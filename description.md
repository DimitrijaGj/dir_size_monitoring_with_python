##     FINAL TOUGHTS     ##
This pythos script monitors directories under the parent directory. 
Not convenient for monitoring specific directory. Only one script can be run pro host. 
That is why I think is usefull only for small environment. 
For better way with node exporter and more Folders simultaneously stay tuned for 
the next video.
